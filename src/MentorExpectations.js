      <h2>Mentor Expectations</h2>
      <h3>Get in touch</h3>
      <p>
        When students contact you, work with your mentees to define the
        relationship early in your correspondences. These terms do not have to
        be final but each member should have some sense of expectations about
        what the relationship will constitute in the dimensions of frequency
        meeting, method of correspondence, and content of what each party is
        hoping to invest and receive from the relationship. Let Weave serve as a
        catalyst for this discussion.
      </p>
      <h3>Stay in touch</h3>
      <p>
        Maintain regular contact with your mentees. Set realistic goals for the
        relationship and how often to meet. Do your best to stick to them and
        communicate when things come up.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3>Share yourself</h3>
      <p>
        Introduce your mentees to your interests and career activities. How did
        you develop your interests? What should mentees look for when
        discovering their own?
      </p>
      <h3>Avoid making judgments or issuing evaluative statements</h3>
      <p>
        Mentors are not expected to evaluate a menteeâ€™s work; rather, unless
        otherwise solicited, a mentor helps a mentee find channels through which
        the mentee can receive objective evaluations and feedback on
        performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Maintain privacy </h3>
      <p>
        Keep the content of discussions within the mentoring relationship
        confidential. All of your exchanges with your mentee, both personal and
        professional, are subject to the expectations of professional
        confidentiality.
      </p>
      <h3>Life happens</h3>
      <p>
        Do not be afraid to end the relationship if either you or your mentee
        are unable to keep your mutually agreed upon expectations.
      </p>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        If ever something occurs in the context of the mentor/mentee
        relationship that makes you uncomfortable or if you are unsure how to
        respond, please do not suffer alone.{' '}
        <Link to="/resources" target="_blank">
          Here
        </Link>{' '}
        are resources that may be helpful starting points in addressing problems
        that you may encounter.
