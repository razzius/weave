    <h2>Mentor Expectations</h2>
    <h3>Get in touch</h3>
    <p>
      When students contact you, work with your mentees to define the
      relationship early in your correspondences. These terms do not have to be
      final but each member should have some sense of expectations about what
      the relationship will constitute in the dimensions of frequency meeting,
      method of correspondence, and content of what each party is hoping to
      invest and receive from the relationship. Let HMS Weave serve as a
      catalyst for this discussion.
    </p>
    <h3>Stay in touch</h3>
    <p>
      Maintain regular contact with your mentees. Set realistic goals for the
      relationship and how often to meet. Do your best to stick to them and
      communicate when things come up.{' '}
    </p>
    <h3>Share yourself</h3>
    <p>
      Introduce your mentees to your interests and career activities. How did
      you develop your interests? What should mentees look for when discovering
      their own?
    </p>
    <h3>Avoid making judgments or issuing evaluative statements</h3>
    <p>
      Mentors are not expected to evaluate a mentee’s work; rather, unless
      otherwise solicited, a mentor helps a mentee find channels through which
      the mentee can receive objective evaluations and feedback on performance.
    </p>
    <h3>Maintain privacy </h3>
    <p>
      Keep the content of discussions within the mentoring relationship
      confidential. All of your exchanges with your mentee, both personal and
      professional, are subject to the expectations of professional
      confidentiality.
    </p>
    <h3>Life happens</h3>
    <p>
      Do not be afraid to end the relationship if either you or your mentee are
      unable to keep your mutually agreed upon expectations.
    </p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>
      If ever something occurs in the context of the mentor/mentee relationship
      that makes you uncomfortable or if you are unsure how to respond, please
      do not suffer alone.{' '}
      <a href="/resources" target="_blank">

      that you may encounter.
