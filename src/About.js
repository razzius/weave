      <h2>About Weave</h2>
      <p>
        Soon after entering medical school and dental school, students encounter
        new learning and social environments and pressure to quickly determine
        academic or clinical interests. While resources for faculty contact
        information exist, both students and faculty have found there to be
        unclear expectations about what a mentorship relationship or experience
        will constitute. Furthermore, for students with myriad interests who are
        still in the process of discovering their desired field of medicine or
        dentistry, it is often challenging to know who to reach out to when
        lists of faculty members are provided solely based on clinical
        specialty.
      </p>

      <p>
        We developed a mentorship platform that provides an interest-driven way
        for students to find invested mentors for professional or personal
        guidance. In recognizing that students may only set expectations for
        their side of the mentoring relationship, our platform allows faculty to
        communicate more clearly their own level of comfort in engaging in a
        mentoring relationship. In recognizing that many clinical, academic, and
        personal demands exist for faculty, we hope to empower faculty to
        articulate what their desired level of mentorship involvement will be.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this platform, faculty may personalize their profiles, including
        sharing a preferred cadence for meeting with students, indicating topics
        that they are willing to discuss, and showing or hiding their profiles
        based on their availability. Students may search for mentors using both
        clinical and non-clinical “tags,” as well as view available faculty
        profiles. In each profile, students will see additional opportunities
        that each faculty offers and other preferences that faculty members have
        chosen for themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope that this mentorship platform provides an opt-in, customized
        mentoring structure with clear, adjustable expectations for both mentors
        and mentees that may encourage more longitudinal and meaningful
        mentoring experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>About Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        In 2017, Weave was co-founded and designed by Jie Jane Chen (Harvard MD
        Class of 2020) and Jonathan Kusner (Harvard MD Class of 2021). The
        website was built by Razzi Abuissa (software engineer). Jane, Jon, and
        Razzi are actively developing Weave to expand its offerings to students,
        residents, and faculty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Jennifer Potter (Advisory Dean for the William Bosworth Castle
        Society) and Dr. Fidencio Saldaña (Dean for Students) are advisors for
        this mentorship initiative, which is endorsed by the Office of Student
        Affairs at Harvard Medical School.
      </p>

      <h2>How Was Weave Developed?</h2>
      <p>
        A student-driven initiative since its conception, Weave incorporates
        both student and faculty perspectives and was created to facilitate
        invested mentoring relationships and to foster diversity and inclusion
        at Harvard Medical School. In working towards these goals, Weave allows
        students to search for mentors in dimensions that are not strictly
        academic or scholastic. Does a faculty member like to cook, are they
        from the west coast, were they also a first generation student, or do
        they share the same faith as you? In addition to empowering students and
        faculty to connect in this way, Weave allows faculty to clearly
        communicate their capacity for mentorship at a given point in time;
        faculty may indicate their preferred meeting cadence, method of contact,
        and any additional opportunities offered so that students can enter with
        realistic expectations for each relationship.
      </p>

      <h2>Does Weave Stand For Something?</h2>
      <p>
        We named our mentorship platform &apos;Weave&apos; to symbolize the
        woven tightness of a tapestry, where each thread is important to
        contributing to the beautiful image when they all come together.
        Similarly, community is enriched through the diversity of identities and
        experiences of individuals. We aspire to illuminate, celebrate, and
        nourish both personal and professional identities and interests through
        this platform.
